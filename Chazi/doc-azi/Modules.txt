The possible info at the moment:

Installation:
  - get the source, compile; find modules at /sym/i386, with .dylib file extension.

  - copy the .dylib files to a Modules folder created on your favorite Extra folder.

  - update boot file or reinstall the booter completely in case it's too old;
	"old" in RC5 world means before rev 168 (atm).

How to use?
  - nothing to do! Modules are loaded at startup, before the Gui loads, providing you place
	them in the correct place (check Issues below).
	
  - Symbols.dylib is always and the first module loaded. The booter will still perform as
	usual if this module fails to load.

What are modules?
  - good question! Well, can't add much on the "geek" side... need to study the stuff so
	i don't start dumping bs. The easy answer is they are like plugins, adding/replacing
	booter functionality. For instance: the Kernel Patcher (Kptchr) is around for some time,
	integrated on boot file like any other Chameleon function; with Modules support Kptchr
	can now live as a module, freeing the space it occupied on boot file
	(one of module's advantages).

Kernel Patcher module:
  - features cpuid_set, commpage_stuff and lapic_init patches (atm).

  -	as it is, Kptchr allows my Pentium D 925 to boot vanilla kernel, with the help of
	-legacy flag; to enter x86_64 world i still need to patch the kernel, as the 925 has no
	Supplemental SSE3 instructions. I assume that, the great majority of the legacy/unsupported
	processors with at least SSE3 instructions, will benefit of the same treatment!
	For now let's just say that the only patch needed by the 925 on Legacy Mode(*) is
	cpuid_set!

(*) For those who "missed" the lesson, Legacy Mode is the mode, 32 bit only cpu's run on OS X.

Issues:
  - modules may fail to load, if you have the booter on a separate device/partition and try
	to load modules from selected volume. Confirmed on MBR/boot0hfs install only.

  - the Kernel Patcher can stop working due to changes on the kernel code, though that can be
	"previewed" to some extent. Just so you know what to expect.

  - this is work in progress; i will add updates as Meklort commits and only if they are in
	functional state.
