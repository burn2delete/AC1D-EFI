- (rev 299)
Change: added "hands off" setting of EFI32 values, for 32 bit only processors.
		Works according to the architecture in use, either chosen by the booter or forced by user.
  Note: on pre 10.6 systems, the default EFI values used for 64 bit processors while booting i386 arch
		(normal arch on these systems) will still be EFI64, which causes absolutely no problem.
		EFI32 values still can be forced by using the respective booter flag.
		Tested only on Leopard.

Motif:  fixes http://forge.voodooprojects.org/p/chameleon/issues/21/.

		---------------//---------------//---------------

- (rev 320)
Change: using the original code i suggested to Mozodojo
		(http://www.projectosx.com/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=1337&view=findpost&p=8809)
		for memory modules Part Number extraction.

Motif:  If i don't do

		if (isspace(sPart[i]))
			break;
		
		i get extra characters that don't belong to the Part Number, according to CPU-Z or
		Everest. This is consistent on the 2 brands of modules i own, Qimonda & Kingston
		and others i saw on some user reports.
		If someone wishes to test this, contact me and i'll cook a booter to help confirm
		(or deny) this behavior.

		---------------//---------------//---------------

- (rev 321)
Change: a change that got hidden on this commit; changed RestartFix from true to false, by default.

Motif:  this goes against one of my "Guide Lines" for the booter! (check README on doc-azi).
		It's absolutely not needed by all users! If someone proves me that this is needed by more
		of 50% of the motherboards Chameleon will ever enconter, then i'll change it back to true ;)
		There's a key for this and i'm not afraid to use it.

		---------------//---------------//---------------

- (rev 335)
Change: merged the educational side of arch=i386 + the practical one of -x32, into a simple 32 flag.
		Type just 32 to get you booted into i386 arch.

  Note: only useful on 64 bit processors.

Motif:  2 keys to do the same, should never had happen!
		I really think that arch=i386 is a more "educational" designation, since what we're really
		doing here is select an architecture to boot, but reading the Chameleon TODO "Integrate...
		quick shortcut modified version of 18seven" and knowing that these shortcuts use the 3 + 2
		key combination to select i386 arch, why not extend it to the prompt boot!?

		---------------//---------------//---------------

- (rev 335)
Change: added -legacy kernel flag. This flag tells the booter to load i386 arch before is passed to
		the kernel. This only needs to be done on Snow Leopard.
		Type -legacy to get you booted into i386 arch, Legacy Mode.

  Note: only useful on 64 bit processors.
  Note: this is not really needed; typing "32 -legacy" (no quotes) does the trick. It's just handy!

  Note: just out of curiosity and for those who don't know, Legacy Mode is in fact the mode used
		by 32 bit "only" processors! Since the OS X kernel can handle 64 bit apps even on i386 arch,
		64 bit processors need this flag to disable any handling of 64 bit instructions, when
		"emulating" a full 32 bit environment.

Motif:  this flag was not being passed on 10.6.x; the reason why is on the kernel code, Legacy Mode
		is only available under i386 arch. So, while testing Meklort's kernel patcher,
		i felt the need to add the key. Maybe i'll remove it later?!

		---------------//---------------//---------------

- (rev 335)
Change: added 64 bit flag to keep company to the 32 one :)
		Type just 64 to get you booted into x86_64 arch.

Motif:  mainly to override 32 or -legacy if they are flagged on the Boot.plist.
		Like -legacy, was born while testing kernel builds.

		---------------//---------------//---------------

- (rev 336)
Change: removed 3 keys to handle PCI Root UID, two of them with exact same code (PCIRootUID & PciRoot).
		Kept just the already existing PciRoot=X, plus the new code.

Motif:  These many keys, should never had happened!
		This came along when the Asere code was ported to Chameleon, but even on Asere's booter,
		what's the need? None!
		The only key in use on his booter is PCIRootUID. The rest is commented out.

- (revs 337 --> 360)
