About me:

  Just the average curious guy, that likes to know a bit of this and that.
  I'm not a skilled coder or even a developer, nor i pretend to be! Just trying to learn,
  share my opinion (as noob as it may be) and give back some help, within my skills,
  knowledge and available time.
  So bare with me :) i'll remember to do the same with you.

  Thanks.

About the branch:

  First, the usual warning: use it at your own risk!
  No, it's not going to set your machine on fire or something like that :)
  Everything is tested on my machine first, but you never know. Be sure you understand
  the changes before you use one of these booters and always keep a plan B!
  
  Although i use this stuff on a daily basis, this is not meant to be an alternative to Chameleon!
  Any use of this booter/s should be considered "testing". If you do find a certain patch or
  functionality useful to your self and the "great" majority of Chameleon users, please make a request
  to the Chameleon team, on the appropriate places(*).
  Any other stuff can/should be reported to me directly, at the forum (*) by pm.
  I might miss a topic so, if you create one, pm me anyway.

  The layout of the branch can change, but at least 2 folders will alway be present (at least for now):
  CleanCut (CC) and Chazileon (Ch), (soon to be just Chazi, to avoid confusion):

    - Ch is the main stuff; it's my work folder, test bed and personal booter. Comparing it to the trunk
	  will probably be a "pain in" for anyone in the future. That's were CC comes in.
	
	- CC will be as close to the trunk as possible and i won't commit there patches that don't work for
	  everyone, like the AutoResolution i use on Ch. It's mean to be compared easily and keep the stuff
	  i consider most useful to Chameleon "at hand". Stuff committed here will always come from Ch!

Guide Lines:

  - simplify booter use as much as possible.
  - make the code more understandable for learners.
  - all files loaded by the booter stay confined to Extra folder.
  - fixes that are not absolutely needed by all the users, should be disabled by default.
  - a few more things that i can't remember right now.... etc etc etc...

  Any feedback is highly appreciated. I mean ANY! Good, bad, suggestion, opinion, bug, issue, etc...
  About requests, keep in mind that my knowledge is limited!
  Think "baby steps" ;)

  Read the rest of the docs for more info and keep an eye on the forge and forum (*) for news.
  Stay safe and enjoy.
