override boot.plist






Just a note on ramdisks: when a rd is aliased as bt(0,0), all paths started by bt(0,0) (booter volume)
will point to the rd and not to the volume were the booter is installed; meaning that, with this algo
that only uses bt(0,0) paths, when using a rd aliased as bt, the rd will be the only volume searched!!
This makes rd's aliased as bt, ideal to load full sets of files, like when using pre-boot discs,
were the files need to be all loaded from the ramdisk into memory.
